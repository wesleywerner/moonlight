[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/wesleywerner/moonlight/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/wesleywerner/moonlight?branch=master)

Moonlight is an interactive fiction world simulator.

It takes care of parsing player sentences, matching the known nouns
in the current room, and simulates world interactions.

Moonlight uses a rule based system to define when and what actions do.

This documentation contains everything you need to learn how to use
Moonlight, including a bunch of working examples.

* See the [License](https://github.com/wesleywerner/moonlight/blob/master/LICENSE) file for copyright information.
* The [User's Guide](https://github.com/wesleywerner/moonlight/blob/master/guide.md) will get you started using Moonlight to create your own IF games.
* The [API Documentation](doc/index.html) provides the full programming reference.
* The [Hacking guide](https://github.com/wesleywerner/moonlight/blob/master/hacking.md) provides technical background for developing and bugfixing Moonlight.

My one request is that you have as much fun using Moonlight as I have creating it. Go forth and create great things!
